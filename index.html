                My name is Serena Gao, and I am a 2nd-year computer science student at the 
                Georgia Institute of Technology. I have received faculty honors for the past three semesters 
                in recognition of my dedication to academics, and I am projected to graduate in May 2023. 
                Currently, I am looking for a Summer 2021 software engineering internship in order to hone 
                my skills and gain new insights into the world of computing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am most interested in the intersection of computing and social good. I am heavily involved 
                in a campus organization, Bits of Good, that utilizes web development in order to 
                serve the community. My greatest wish is to be able to apply the knowledge that I have learned through 
                my classes to create positive change in the world around me. As such, any internship experience 
                would be pivotal in helping me achieve this.
